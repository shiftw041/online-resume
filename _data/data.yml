    The project section in a resume is a section where you can highlight any significant projects that you have completed during your education, work experience, or personal endeavors. This section provides a detailed description of your projects that can showcase your skills, abilities, and achievements.

    In this section, you should include the name of the project, the role you played in the project, the duration, the tools and technologies you used, the objective of the project, and the outcome or result achieved. You can also include any relevant metrics or data that demonstrate the impact of the project.

    The project section is especially useful for candidates with limited work experience or those looking to highlight specific skills or accomplishments that may not be apparent in other parts of their resume. It can also be beneficial for candidates in technical or creative fields, where projects play a significant role in showcasing their capabilities.

    - name: Innovative Entrepreneurship Training Project — Predicting Chip Packaging Test Termination Based on Diffusion Model
      link: '#'
      tags:
      date: 2023.03 - 2023.11
      description: |
        Investigated the application of diffusion model algorithms in the EDA chip domain, improving fault diagnosis efficiency and quality by transforming test feedback into images.Designed machine learning algorithms combined with dynamic test termination prediction, using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model to expand the image dataset for training.
        + Achieved higher accuracy and nearly 90% cost savings in test cost with the new scheme compared to the original one.
        + Team contributed the paper "Translating Test Responses to Images for Test-termination Prediction via Multiple Machine Learning Strategies," submitted to ACM-TODEAS (CCF-B).

      date: 2023.12 - Present
      description: |
        Researched the application of federated learning in medical image segmentation, addressing issues of complex model structure and high computational cost.Explored and integrated Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for model compression and inference acceleration, reducing computational load to approximately one-fourth of the floating-point precision with minimal loss of accuracy.
        + The team is currently writing a paper expected to be submitted to IEEE-BIBM (CCF-B).
    - name: Information Security Competition — Multimodal Audio Attack Detection Based on Neural Networks
      link: '#'
      tags:
      date: 2023.12 - Present
      description: |
        Designed and implemented an intelligent detection system for multimodal audio attacks in voice recognition systems, showing good performance in detecting synthetic, replay, and adversarial attacks.
        + Developed an efficient voiceprint feature extraction and analysis system based on the residual network, integrating the Res2Net with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) module.Achieved high accuracy and generalization in detecting synthetic and replay attacks with an EER of less than 1% using the international ASVSpoof dataset.
        + Employed a generative adversarial network to construct a neural vocoder to rebuild voice waveforms, identifying adversarial samples with unknown attack methods, with an AUC of 99% on the VoxCeleb open-source dataset.
